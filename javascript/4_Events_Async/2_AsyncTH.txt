--> Javascript is a synchronous language in which the code is executed in the flow as it is written
-->Java is asynchrounous language because of use of threads in it.
--> Javascript is a single threaded language.

--> Execution Phase -- Each execution wait for the last one to complete it before executing current one.

                                                TWO TYPES OF CODE IN JAVASCRIPT
                            1.BLOCKING CODE --> Block the flow of the progrm and read the file synchronously
                            2.Non Blocking Code --> Dont block the flow of file and read the file Async.


--> JS ENGINE -->> 1. Memory Heap
                   2. Call Stack --> Global Execution Context

--> Web Api -->>> For Async Code  --> 1. DOM Api
                                      2.Set Timeout
                                      3.Set Interval

                                      --> Register CallBack --> 2 MIN Bad set timeout / events execute krna hai

                                      --> This Register callback now connected to the Task queue.

                                      -->Task Queue will give the task back to the call stack to execute.

          ---> New API  are added in the javascript.
                ---> Fetch API -- It also work on the queue but the High priority queue.(PROMISES)
